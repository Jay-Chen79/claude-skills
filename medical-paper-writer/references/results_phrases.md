## 一、研究流程描述

### 筛选过程

```
A total of [N] patients were initially screened for eligibility.

[N] patients (X%) completed the entire study protocol.

At the end of follow-up, [N] events (X%) had occurred.

【显著差异】
The mean [指标] was significantly higher/lower in the [组1] group compared with the [组2] group (XX ± XX vs. XX ± XX, P = 0.XXX).

Patients in the [组1] group showed a significantly greater improvement in [指标] than those in the [组2] group (mean difference: XX, 95% CI: XX-XX, P = 0.XXX).

【无显著差异】
There was no significant difference in [指标] between the two groups (XX ± XX vs. XX ± XX, P = 0.XXX).

The [指标] was similar between groups (P = 0.XXX).
```

### 组间差异-分类变量

```
【显著差异】
The incidence of [结局] was significantly higher in the [组1] group than in the [组2] group (XX% vs. XX%, P = 0.XXX).

A significantly greater proportion of patients in the [组1] group achieved [结局] compared with the [组2] group (XX% vs. XX%, P = 0.XXX).

【无显著差异】
The proportion of patients with [结局] did not differ significantly between groups (XX% vs. XX%, P = 0.XXX).
```

### 变化趋势

```
[指标] decreased/increased significantly from baseline to [时间点] (from XX to XX, P = 0.XXX).

A significant reduction/improvement in [指标] was observed after [干预/时间] (P = 0.XXX).

[指标] showed a gradual decline/increase over the study period.

The change in [指标] was more pronounced in the [组1] group than in the [组2] group (P for interaction = 0.XXX).
```

## 四、关联性描述

### 相关关系

```
【正相关】
There was a significant positive correlation between [变量1] and [变量2] (r = 0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

Higher levels of [变量1] were associated with higher levels of [变量2] (r = 0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

【负相关】
A significant negative/inverse correlation was observed between [变量1] and [变量2] (r = -0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

[变量1] was inversely associated with [变量2] (r = -0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

【无相关】
No significant correlation was found between [变量1] and [变量2] (r = 0.XX, P = 0.XXX).
```

### 回归分析-危险/保护因素

```
【危险因素】
[因素] was independently associated with an increased risk of [结局] (OR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX, P = 0.XXX).

In multivariate analysis, [因素] remained a significant predictor of [结局] (adjusted OR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX, P = 0.XXX).

Each unit increase in [因素] was associated with a XX% increase in the odds of [结局] (OR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX).

【保护因素】
[因素] was associated with a decreased risk of [结局] (OR = 0.XX, 95% CI: 0.XX-0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

Patients with [因素] had significantly lower odds of developing [结局] (OR = 0.XX, 95% CI: 0.XX-0.XX, P = 0.XXX).

【无显著关联】
No significant association was found between [因素] and [结局] (OR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX, P = 0.XXX).

## 五、生存分析描述

### Kaplan-Meier分析

```
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in Figure X.

The median survival time was XX months (95% CI: XX-XX months) in the [组1] group and XX months (95% CI: XX-XX months) in the [组2] group.

The X-year overall survival rate was XX% in the [组1] group compared with XX% in the [组2] group (log-rank P = 0.XXX).

### Cox回归

```
In multivariate Cox regression analysis, [因素] was an independent predictor of [结局] (HR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX, P = 0.XXX).

The effect of [干预/暴露] on [结局] was consistent across subgroups defined by [变量] (P for interaction = 0.XXX).

A significant interaction was observed between [干预/暴露] and [变量] (P for interaction = 0.XXX).

The benefit of [干预] was more pronounced in patients with [特征] than in those without (P for interaction = 0.XXX).

Subgroup analyses are presented in Figure X.

The forest plot showing subgroup analyses is displayed in Figure X.

Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results.

The results remained robust in sensitivity analyses.

Excluding patients with [特征] did not substantially change the results (OR = X.XX, 95% CI: X.XX-X.XX).

Similar results were obtained when using alternative definitions for [变量].

The findings were consistent across all sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table X).
