## 3. Introduction (700-800 words)

Use **funnel structure** — broad to specific:

### Paragraph 1: Context (150-200 words)
- Open with a striking fact, statistic, or clinical scenario
- Establish the clinical/social significance of the topic
- Define key terms

### Paragraph 2: Literature Review (200-250 words)
- What is known from existing research (quantitative + qualitative)
- Identify the specific gap: population, context, methodology, or phenomenon not yet studied
- Gap statement: "No published [methodology] study has examined [phenomenon] among [population] in [context]."

### Paragraph 3: Theoretical Framework (150-200 words)
- Name 1-2 sensitizing frameworks
- Briefly explain core concepts relevant to study
- State how frameworks will guide (not constrain) analysis
- Cite seminal works

### Paragraph 4: Research Questions (100 words)
- State research question(s) explicitly
- Format: "This study aimed to explore [phenomenon] among [population] in [context] using [methodology]."
- Optional: Add sub-questions

---

## 4. Methods (1200-1500 words)

Organize with COREQ-aligned subsections:

### 4.1 Study Design
- Name methodology + cite foundational reference
- State philosophical/epistemological stance
- Justify why this methodology suits the research question

### 4.2 Setting
- Describe the research site (type, size, patient volume, staffing)
- Provide enough contextual detail for transferability judgments
- Do NOT name the institution (blinding)

### 4.3 Participants
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Sampling strategy (purposive, maximum variation, theoretical)
- Sample size justification: cite information power (Malterud et al., 2016) AND empirical benchmarks (Hennink & Kaiser, 2022)
- Table 1: Participant demographics (ID, role, gender, experience, education)

### 4.4 Data Collection
- Interview type (semi-structured, in-depth)
- Interview guide development process (literature-based + pilot-tested)
- Recording method, interview duration range, location
- Field notes protocol
- Data saturation: how tracked, when reached

### 4.5 Data Analysis
- Name specific analysis method + cite reference
- Describe step-by-step process
- Number of coders, consensus process
- Software used
- How themes were derived (inductively, abductively)

### 4.6 Rigour / Trustworthiness
- Lincoln & Guba (1985) criteria: credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability
- Specific strategies: member checking, peer debriefing, audit trail, reflexive journaling, triangulation
- Reporting standard: COREQ (Tong et al., 2007)

### 4.7 Ethical Considerations
- Ethics committee name + approval number
- Informed consent process
- Anonymisation strategy
- Data storage and access

### 4.8 Reflexivity Statement
- 4-dimension framework (Olmos-Vega et al., 2022)
- Address insider/outsider status explicitly
- How researcher positionality may have influenced data collection and interpretation

---

## 5. Results (2500-3500 words)

### 5.1 Opening: Thick Description / Setting Vignette (200-300 words)
- Ethnographic snapshot of the research setting
- Sensory details: sounds, sights, spatial layout, pace of work
- Temporal rhythm: how a typical day/shift unfolds
- Purpose: immerse the reader in the participants' world

### 5.2 Theme Presentation

For each theme (typically 4-6 themes):

**Structure per theme (400-600 words)**:

1. **Theme heading**: Short, evocative phrase (not a full sentence)
2. **Analytic statement**: 1-2 sentences defining what this theme captures
3. **Evidence block 1**: Quote from Participant X (role A) + interpretation
4. **Evidence block 2**: Quote from Participant Y (role B) + interpretation
5. **Cross-role pattern**: How this theme manifests across different participant types
6. **Boundary/disconfirming case**: Quote or observation that qualifies or challenges the theme
7. **Analytic commentary**: Interpretation beyond description — connect to theory, identify mechanisms

**Quote formatting**:
- Indent block quotes
- Include participant ID: (P03, Scrub Nurse, 12 years)
- Preserve vivid language; use [...] for omissions
- Italicize Chinese/non-English terms with English translation

### 5.3 Theme Relationships
- Describe how themes connect (sequential, hierarchical, cyclical)
- Reference Figure 1 (thematic model)
- Identify overarching narrative or conceptual contribution

---

## 6. Discussion (2000-2500 words)

### 6.1 Opening Summary (150-200 words)
- Restate key findings without repeating Results
- Name the overarching contribution: "This study reveals [conceptual insight]..."

### 6.2 Theory Dialogue (1200-1500 words)
- For each major theme, engage with existing literature:
  - **Confirm**: "Consistent with [Author, Year], our findings show..."
  - **Extend**: "Beyond [Author]'s framework, our data suggest..."
  - **Challenge**: "Contrary to [Author, Year], participants in our study..."
- Propose new conceptual contributions: name phenomena discovered (e.g., "competence paradox," "temporal compression")
- Connect findings to sensitizing frameworks introduced in Introduction

### 6.3 Implications (400-500 words)

Three categories:
1. **Clinical/Practice**: Specific, actionable recommendations
2. **Education/Training**: What should be taught differently?
3. **Policy/Management**: What structural changes are needed?

Each implication must be grounded in specific findings.

### 6.4 Limitations (200-300 words)
- Acknowledge honestly but frame constructively
- Common qualitative limitations to address:
  - Single-site / context specificity → transferability, not generalisability
  - Insider researcher status → reflexivity measures taken
  - Cross-sectional snapshot → longitudinal follow-up needed
  - Simulated data (if applicable) → clearly label as educational/pilot
- Do NOT apologise for using qualitative methods or small samples

### 6.5 Future Research (100-150 words)
- 2-3 specific directions arising from findings
- Include at least one that addresses a limitation

---

## 7. References

- **Format**: Vancouver (numbered, order of citation) for IJNS; APA 7th for JAN, QHR
- **Verify**: Every reference needs DOI + PMID (if indexed)
- **Recency**: ≥50% from past 5 years; seminal works exempt
- **Balance**: Include both quantitative and qualitative sources
- **Self-citation**: ≤10% of total references

| ID | Role | Gender | Age Range | Experience (years) | Education |
|----|------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| P01 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Table 2: Theme Summary (Optional)
