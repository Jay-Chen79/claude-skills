|---|------|-------------|------|
| 24 | Number of data coders | How many data coders coded the data? | |
| 25 | Description of the coding tree | Did authors provide a description of the coding tree? | |
| 26 | Derivation of themes | Were themes identified in advance or derived from the data? | |
| 27 | Software | What software, if applicable, was used to manage the data? | |
| 28 | Participant checking | Did participants provide feedback on the findings? | |

### Reporting

| # | Item | Description | Page |
|---|------|-------------|------|
| 29 | Quotations presented | Were participant quotations presented to illustrate themes/findings? Was each quotation identified (e.g., participant number)? | |
| 30 | Data and findings consistent | Was there consistency between the data presented and the findings? | |
| 31 | Clarity of major themes | Were major themes clearly presented in the findings? | |
| 32 | Clarity of minor themes | Is there a description of diverse cases or discussion of minor themes? | |

## Top 5 Most Commonly Missed Items

Based on Walsh et al. (2020) — only 5% of published qualitative papers score ≥25/32:

1. **#8 Interviewer characteristics / reflexivity** — State background, assumptions, biases, and how they may influence interpretation. Use the 4-dimension framework (Olmos-Vega et al., 2022): personal, interpersonal, methodological, contextual.

2. **#6 Relationship established** — Explicitly state whether a prior relationship existed. If the researcher is an insider (e.g., colleague), discuss implications for data quality and steps taken to mitigate bias.

3. **#22 Data saturation** — Report: (a) how saturation was defined, (b) at which interview it was reached, (c) what criteria were used (no new codes vs. no new themes). Reference: Hennink & Kaiser (2022).

4. **#13 Non-participation** — Report how many were invited, how many refused, and reasons for refusal. This is frequently omitted entirely.

5. **#25 Coding tree** — Provide a visual hierarchy from initial codes → sub-themes → themes. Can be a figure, table, or supplementary file.

## Insider Researcher Considerations

When the researcher is a member of the studied community (e.g., a nurse studying nurses in their own unit):

- **Advantages**: Deep contextual understanding, trust, access
- **Risks**: Assumed shared understanding, difficulty maintaining analytic distance, power dynamics
- **Mitigations to report**:
  - Bracketing or reflexive journaling
  - External auditor for coding
  - Member checking with participants from different seniority levels
  - Reflexivity statement addressing insider status explicitly
